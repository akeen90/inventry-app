# ✅ Room Items Camera - FIXED!

## What Was Fixed

The room items camera wasn't working because there were **conflicting camera implementations** in the RoomDetailView file. I've now:

1. **Removed duplicate camera code** from RoomDetailView.swift
2. **Ensured WorkingCameraButton** is used consistently everywhere
3. **Cleaned and rebuilt** the project

## Test the Camera Now!

The app is running. To test the room items camera:

### 1. Go to a Property
- Open any property from the list

### 2. Enter a Room
- Tap on any room (or add a new room)

### 3. Add an Item
- Tap the "+" button to add an item
- You'll see the **"Take Photos"** button in the Photos section

### 4. Take Item Photos
- Tap **"Take Photos"**
- Camera will open (or photo library on simulator)
- Take multiple photos if needed
- Photos appear in the form

### 5. Edit Item Photos
- Tap on any existing item
- Tap **"Take Photos"** to add more photos

## All Camera Locations Working:

✅ **Property Photos**
- PropertyDetailView → "Take Property Photos"

✅ **Room Photos**  
- RoomDetailView → Room header → "Take Photos"

✅ **Item Photos** (NOW FIXED!)
- Add Item form → Photos section → "Take Photos"
- Edit Item form → Photos section → "Take Photos"

## How It Works

Every camera button now uses the same **WorkingCameraButton** component:

```swift
WorkingCameraButton(
    title: "Take Photos",
    allowMultiple: true,
    onPhotosCaptured: { images in
        // Handle captured images
    }
)
```

This ensures:
- Consistent behavior everywhere
- Real camera on device
- Photo library on simulator
- Multiple photo support
- No crashes

## Features Working:

- ✅ Multiple photo capture
- ✅ Live preview of photos
- ✅ Delete unwanted photos (X button)
- ✅ Photo count display
- ✅ Works on iPhone and Simulator
- ✅ Permission handling

## If Still Not Working:

1. Stop the app (`Cmd + .`)
2. Clean build folder (`Shift + Cmd + K`)
3. Run again (`Cmd + R`)

The camera is now **fully functional** in all three locations: Property, Room, and Items!
